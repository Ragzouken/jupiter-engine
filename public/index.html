            <p>city residents can expect curfews, rolling lockdowns, and random testing within the coming months</p><img src="assets/security.png" alt="private security checkpoint"/>

            <h1>euphoron orgy suicide</h1>
            <p>enhanced libido has long been among the [alleged effects of euphoron|rumour-3-euphoron-trip], but more and more cases are emerging of suicide under the effects of euphoron, often with a highly sexual component</p>
            <p>one high profile case, ritualistic assumed connected to [euphoron cults|rumour-3-euphoron-gift], involved an orgy of a dozen people under the influence of severe euphoron overdose</p>
            <p>euphoron overdose results in extreme physiological changes to the body and a drawn out brain death that is irreversible</p>
            <p>in line with concern of [pathonogenic danger|science-euphoron-effects] in advanced euphoron effects, [reported cases|inteltrax-3-euphoron-control] are met with euthanasia and incineration</p><img src="assets/orgy.png" alt="a dozen naked bodies in a sexual orgy"/>

            <p>clinical trials are still ongoing and the full effects of euphoron are not yet known</p>
            <p>in both animals and humans, euphoron acts like a mild virus, hijacking the cells of the body to replicate</p>
            <p>at low doses this replication is not self-sustaining and euphoron present in the body is quickly consumed</p>
            <p>initial trials suggest a number of extraordinary therapeutic outcomes as well as highly potent analgesic and euphoric effects</p>
            <p>euphoron overdose is highly toxic, leading to irreversible self-sustaining runaway production and secretion of [euphoron-b|science-euphoron-b] by the body</p>
